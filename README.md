Java chat client using sockets and threads
--------

This project contains the sample code I use while teaching Sockets and Threads (concurrent programming) 
in my Java classes. The main idea is that when programming concurrent code in java you should use as 
little explicit synchronization as possible and everyting should be done by message passing.
